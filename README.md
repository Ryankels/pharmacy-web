* **Input/Forms:** `<form>`, `<fieldset>`, `<legend>`, `<input type="file">`, `<select>`, `<datalist>`.
* **Metadata:** `<time>`, `<address>`, `<cite>`, `<blockquote>`, `<details>`, `<summary>`.

### 2. Required List and Table Structures

| Structure Type | Page Location | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Table** | `products.html` | Displays the **Key Product Details** (Name, Area, Status). |
| **Table** | `careers.html` | Summarizes **Employee Benefits** (Category, Detail). |
| **Ordered List (`<ol>`)** | `products.html` | Provides clear **Dosage Instructions**. |
